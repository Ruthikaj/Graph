Let's explain the code step by step like a simple game for a 6-year-old:

### 1. The `find()` Function:

This function helps us **find the leader** (or "ultimate parent") of any friend.

#### Code:
```cpp
int find(int a[], int x)
{
    // If 'x' is its own leader, return 'x'
    if (a[x] == x)
        return x;
    
    // Otherwise, find the leader of 'a[x]' and set it as the leader of 'x'
    return a[x] = find(a, a[x]);
}
```

#### Simple Explanation:
- Imagine every friend starts as their own **leader**.
- The `find()` function checks: **"Who is the leader of this friend?"**
  - If the friend is their own leader, we just return them.
  - If they have a different leader, we keep asking until we reach the **ultimate leader**.
  - Once we find the topmost leader, we remember it for next time.

#### Example:

Let's say `a[] = [1, 2, 1, 4, 5]`:

- If you ask for **Friend 3's** leader (`find(a, 3)`):
  - First, we see that `a[3] = 1`. So, Friend 3 follows Friend 1.
  - Then, we check **Friend 1's leader**, and since `a[1] = 1`, Friend 1 is their own leader.
  - So, the **leader of Friend 3** is **1**.

#### What is Happening in Each Line:

1. **`if (a[x] == x)`**:
   - This line checks: "Is Friend X their own leader?"
   - If **yes**, return X because they're their own leader.
   
2. **`return a[x] = find(a, a[x]);`**:
   - This line means: if Friend X isn't their own leader, find the leader of their current leader and return it.
   - It also **remembers** the leader for next time by setting `a[x]` to the ultimate leader.

---

### 2. The `unionSet()` Function:

This function helps us **connect two friends** so they share the same leader.

#### Code:
```cpp
void unionSet(int a[], int x, int z)
{
    // Find the leader of 'x' (let's call it 'ux')
    int ux = find(a, x);
    
    // Find the leader of 'z' (let's call it 'uz')
    int uz = find(a, z);
    
    // Make the leader of 'x' follow the leader of 'z'
    a[ux] = uz;
}
```

#### Simple Explanation:
- This function connects **two friends** by making them share the same **leader**.
- It finds out the leaders of both friends first and then says: "Friend X, from now on, you follow the leader of Friend Z."

#### Example:

Let's say `a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:

- Now you call `unionSet(a, 3, 1)`:
  - First, we find that **Friend 3's leader** is 3 (because `a[3] = 3`).
  - Then, we find that **Friend 1's leader** is 1 (because `a[1] = 1`).
  - Now, we say: **Friend 3, you follow Friend 1's leader**.
  - So, after this, `a[]` becomes `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]`. Now Friend 3's leader is 1.

#### What is Happening in Each Line:

1. **`int ux = find(a, x);`**:
   - This finds the leader of **Friend X** (let's call it `ux`).
   - For example, if X is Friend 3, `ux` will be the leader of Friend 3.
   
2. **`int uz = find(a, z);`**:
   - This finds the leader of **Friend Z** (let's call it `uz`).
   - For example, if Z is Friend 1, `uz` will be the leader of Friend 1.
   
3. **`a[ux] = uz;`**:
   - This makes the **leader of X follow the leader of Z**.
   - In the example, Friend 3 now follows the leader of Friend 1.

---

### Putting it All Together

- The `find()` function **finds the leader** of a friend.
- The `unionSet()` function **connects two friends** by making one friend follow the otherâ€™s leader.

#### Example Game:

Let's take a simple example:

You have 5 friends: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Initially, each friend is their own leader:
```
Friend 1 â†’ Leader 1  
Friend 2 â†’ Leader 2  
Friend 3 â†’ Leader 3  
Friend 4 â†’ Leader 4  
Friend 5 â†’ Leader 5
```

1. **Find(4)**: The leader of Friend 4 is 4.
2. **Find(1)**: The leader of Friend 1 is 1.
3. **unionSet(3, 1)**: Connect Friend 3 to Friend 1. Now Friend 3 follows Leader 1.
   - Now, the list looks like this:
   ```
   Friend 1 â†’ Leader 1  
   Friend 2 â†’ Leader 2  
   Friend 3 â†’ Leader 1  
   Friend 4 â†’ Leader 4  
   Friend 5 â†’ Leader 5
   ```
4. **Find(3)**: Now the leader of Friend 3 is 1 (because Friend 3 now follows Friend 1).

---

### Key Points to Remember:
1. **Each friend starts as their own leader**.
2. The `find()` function helps us figure out who the **ultimate leader** of any friend is.
3. The `unionSet()` function connects two friends, making one follow the other's leader.
